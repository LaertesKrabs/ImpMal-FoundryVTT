# Frequently Asked Questions

Below is a list of questions new users might often raise as they explore the system


## General

### Something is wrong! What do I do?

{: .question}
This depends on what the problem is exactly! See [Troubleshooting](./troubleshooting).

### I bought this but I don't see any content!

{: .question}
See the page on [Buying, Registering, Installing, and Activating Premium Content](./premium)

## Usage

### How doees Opposed Test / Attacking work?

{: .question}
See [the Flow of Combat](./basics/combat.md)

### How do I configure Zones?
See [Using Zones](./basics/zones.md)

### How do I advance characteristics and skillS?

{: .question}
See the [Advancement](./basics/advancement.md) window.

### How do I advance skills and add talents without spending experience during character creation?

{: .question}
The amount of XP spent is re-calculated every time the Actor is updated, and it doesn't know what advancement or Item may have come from character creation, resulting in some amount of XP spent. This can be fixed by adding an "Offset" in the [Advancement](./basics/advancement.md) window. If using the automated character creator, it will automatically add this offset.

### Why can't I see pins on the map? Like on the Macharian Sector Scene?

{: .question}
Journal Pins / Notes on a Scene are only visible whe on the Notes layer  (the dovetail flag on the left side controls). For more details, see the [Knowledge Base](https://foundryvtt.com/article/map-notes/)

### The Macharian Sector map has Journal pins that don't do anything when I click them!

{: .question}
There are many more icons/labels/locations on the map than are detailed in the book. Everything not detailed still has a journal pin, but with no journal reference, these merely serve as labels. If a future book adds detail to them, I will try to add the reference to the pin in the sector map

### How do I use/add Psychic Powers?

{: .question}
The Powers tab appears on a character sheet only if they have a Psychic Power to begin with, so you'll need to add one to the Actor, either from the world or a Compendium.

###  What Chat Commands are available?

{: .question}
See [Chat Commands](./basics/commands.md), also enter in `/help` within Foundry.
